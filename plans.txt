This is future plan for this project:

Create desktop app that implements gui for this program.
Later on, I might use inheritance to abstract out an algorithm:
"Action happens when specified time happens"
This could be anything. This FileDeleter class would be one implementation of such abstract class.
I could ultimately make timer for everything (or every action that's scriptable)
